# Voice_Processing_Project
This project demonstrates audio transmission using DSBSC modulation. A 1024-sample audio signal is modulated with a sine wave carrier and processed through various blocks including BPF, LPF, and spectrum analyzers. At the receiver, noise is added, and both the signal graph and spectrum are plotted for analysis.
